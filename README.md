# File-manager-Automation-Script
Developed ideally for 'Downloads' folder automation. Organizes files in the directory as Pictures, Videos, Audios and Documents.(Windows OS)

If you are using Linux, I think you can develop it yourself.

OVERVIEW
--------

+ Creates folders "Pictures", "Videos", "Audios" and "Documents" if it does not exist.
